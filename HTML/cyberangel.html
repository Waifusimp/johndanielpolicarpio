			Corrupt binary codes infecting my mind<br>
			Perform invocation with numbing freeze<br>
			Querying for a variable<br>
			And seizing the time<br>
			To recomplie and trigger my destiny<br>
		<br>
			Though my wings been bloodstained<br>
			And could never rid<br>
			I'll try hard to soar<br>
			To the heaven I dreamed<br>
			There is no "exception" in this library<br>
			For I know I will always go with you<br>
		<br>
			Superhot projectiles pierce the wind<br>
			I charged up my armor into lightspeed<br>
			Querying for a variable<br>
			And seizing the time<br>
			In a new day coming not so far away<br>
		<br>	
			Though my wings been bloodstained<br>
			And could never rid<br>
			I'll try hard to soar<br>
			To the heaven I dreamed<br>
			There is no "exception" in this library<br>
			For I know I will always go with you<br>
		<br>
			Though my wings been bloodstained<br>
			And could never rid<br>
			I'll try hard to soar<br>
			To the heaven I dreamed<br>
			There is no "exception" in this library<br>
			For I know I will always go<br>
			<br>	
			With my heart<br>
