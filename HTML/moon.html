			Some deserts of this planet were oceans once <br>
Somewhere shrouded by the night, the sun will shine <br>
Sometimes I see a dying bird fall to the ground <br>
But it used to fly so high <br>
<br>
I thought I were no more than a bystander <br>
'Til I felt a touch so real <br>
I will no longer be a transient <br>
When I see smiles with tears <br>
If I have never known the sore of farewell <br>
And pain of sacrifices <br>
What else should I engrave on my mind <br>
<br>
Frozen into icy rocks <br>
That's how it starts (that's how it starts) <br>
Crumbled like the sands of time <br>
That's how it ends (that's how it ends) <br>
Every page of tragedy <br>
Is thrown away (is thrown away) <br>
Burned out in the flame <br>
<br>
A shoulder for the past <br>
Let out the cries imprisoned for so long <br>
A pair of wings for me at this moment <br>
To soar above this world <br>
Turn into a shooting star <br>
That briefly shines but warms up every heart <br>
May all the beauty be blessed <br>
May all the beauty be blessed <br>
<br>
I will never go <br>
There's a way back home <br>
Brighter than tomorrow and yesterday <br>
May all the beauty be blessed <br>
<br>
Wave goodbye to the past when hope and faith <br>
Have grown so strong and sound <br>
(Have grown so strong and sound) <br>
Unfold this pair of wings for me again <br>
To soar above this world (soar above this world) <br>
Turned into a moon that always tells the warmth <br>
And brightness of the sun (and brightness of the sun) <br>
May all the beauty be blessed <br>
May all the beauty be blessed <br>
